Hello! 👋 I'm excited to share my latest project, the "Calorie Counter," where I've applied my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. Let me give you a brief overview:

# 📌 Project Name: Calorie Counter
This web application helps users track their daily calorie intake and manage their fitness goals effectively.

# 📋 Project Description:
The Calorie Counter allows users to set a daily calorie budget, add entries for meals and exercises, and calculates the remaining calories. Each entry dynamically generates input fields for name and calories. The app helps users maintain a healthy lifestyle by providing instant feedback on their calorie consumption, helping them stay on track.

    **JavaScript**: To add dynamic functionality, calculate calories, and enhance user interaction.

# 🌟 Key Features:
    Dynamic Entry Addition: Users can add entries for meals and exercises dynamically, providing a personalized experience.
    Real-time Calorie Calculation: The application calculates consumed, burned, and remaining calories in real-time, providing instant feedback.
    Clear and Responsive Design: The user interface is designed for clarity and responsiveness, ensuring an optimal user experience across devices.

# 🙌 Why it Matters:
The Calorie Counter is not just a project; it's a tool to promote a healthier lifestyle. By making calorie tracking accessible and user-friendly, it empowers individuals to make informed choices about their nutrition and fitness goals.

# 🚀 What's Next:
I'm passionate about continuous improvement. In the future, I plan to enhance the application with additional features, personalized user profiles, and integration with fitness trackers for a seamless experience.
